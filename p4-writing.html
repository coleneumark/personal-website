    <h2>Part 1</h2>
    <h4>Chapter 1 – Blood and Gold</h4>
    <p id="special-char">His steps echoed back at him in the narrow shopping street. His ears were filled with the occasional voices and electronic doors sliding open, detecting ghosts and the fleeting interest of people. Yet, his pounding heart was the loudest sound as he walked faster in the direction of the store. He should have not been this scared to pick some cookies for himself, against the strict rules of his dietician and personal trainer, he told himself, but his palms were wet against the leather of his gloves. His sports jacket was the most normal clothing he possessed, so wearing it with thick sunglasses with their disturbing golden trim and his special turtleneck shirt appeared like a good idea when he had left his empty house. Trekking down the driveway and escaping his property through the hidden hole in the hedge was a thing of spontaneity and rebellion. He had to do it. He had to prove to himself that he could do it. Staying in that house could never be elevating for his mental and physical health. He just wanted to pretend for one short moment that he was like them. Especially, on this day. He deserved those cookies, and he could not understand how they had been out of them when he needed them the most.</p>
    <p>Clenching the shopping bag with his left hand and aiming for the end of the street, a good spot to be picked up by a cab, he did not react in time when a child shoved itself in front of him. The little boy grinned up at him with his apparent tooth gap and offered the man his banged-up frisbee. He did not know how to react to it, simply staring down at the doe-eyed child.</p>
    <p>‘Please, Goldenboy, can you do it?’, said the boy in a perfect tone and mimicked Eon’s motions to not let him escape. Eon gulped and shook his head, analysing how many people have noticed the name. A couple not far from him stopped in their tracks and started to point at Eon within their enthusiastic conversation.</p>
    <p>Controlling his breathing as best as he could, he answered: ‘I am sorry. I am not allowed to do that.’ The eyes free from any malintent were still expecting the trade, and Eon continued spouting out apologies. ‘I would if I could, but I am really not allowed. I am sorry.’ He could fix this boy’s life with one movement of his little finger. The holes in the boy’s gloves and the speck of dirt on his nose haunted consciousness when he finally escaped the grasp of the childish movements.</p>
    <p>‘Aw, Goldenboy!’, shouted the boy behind him, making Eon feel like a monster, but he had to continue his journey towards the end of the street. More people started to notice him. People in suits were staring into his direction from behind an advertising pillar.</p>
    <p>‘It’s Goldenboy! Can you believe it?’, shouted another deeper voice from behind him, and excited shrieking came from all sides. Pictures were taken. People were filming him with their phones. Filming all around him. They were all staring at him.</p>
    <p>‘Oh my God!’ ‘It’s him!’ ‘Goldenboy, can you give me an autograph?’ ‘Will you take a selfie with me?’</p>
    <p>It was overwhelming without the security of bodyguards or fences on his side. His paranoia took over and he checked his gloves and clothing for any open patches. He had covered up as much skin as he could but were those people to encircle him and press against him, he knew it would not be enough. </p>
    <p>‘How can you deny this to one of your biggest fans?’, asked a woman close to the boy and shoved him repeatedly toward Eon. ‘We all know you can do it.’ She was wearing a leather jacket and her tinted glasses accentuated her eyeliner and false eyelashes. The boy grinned at her and moved closer. It was his mother. The picture of mother and child made Eon gulp once more, but he was determined to move on. They were following him. It was fake.</p>
    <p>He forced the sweetest smile he could manage. ‘I am bound by national law, Miss. I am truly sorry. Please contact my manager for a special headshot and signature.’ After waving to some of the other fans and smiling at their individual cameras, he pressed his cookies against his chest and started moving even quicker than before. He had left his house alone. His thoughts were concentrated on the end of the street, not the group of men that were following him. He could hear them, yes, but he could not do anything about it. They would do it in broad daylight if they had the opportunity, so Eon hurried to take that opportunity from them.</p>
    <p>When he could see the yellow car around the corner, someone grabbed him by his shoulder and threw him off balance. Sensations of movement, breathing, a hard wall pressed against his back, and the cold ground. The bag of cookies was lying in a puddle in front of him, just slightly out of reach. Eon did not even care about them anymore, desperately trying to cover his face as best as he could without touching it. Yet, on his way down, his gloves had accidentally bumped against his cheek and caused a rough landing. A steady stream of hot blood dripped from his forehead into his eyes.</p>
    <p>‘Please, please, stop this. I do not want to hurt you. Please, stay away. Do not touch me.’, said Eon as clearly as he could and was shoved face-down onto the ground as a response. There was a chuckle somewhere between the excited voices speaking in multiple foreign languages. Eon had no time to escape or find a solution to the problem or even understand where he was, because he was repeatedly kicked into his stomach and back. Somebody kicked his shin and he could feel the radiant spiderweb of nerves burn through his entire leg.</p>
    <p>Everything was in pain after some more kicks and he groaned through his sobbing. It was his fault. He could just die on this dirty, wet ground smelling like wet dog and rotting trash. It did not matter.</p>
    <p>‘Pack him up already.’, said a female voice and Eon placed it immediately. It was the woman with the boy. This entire operation had been planned. Then, a kick to the face forced his gloved hand directly against it and caused more damage than mere leather could have done. The world around Eon turned black and he felt a tinge of relief.</p>
