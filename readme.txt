Web Application Development
Assignment 1: HTML and CSS

###My thought on concept & design:###
For my website project, I decided to make a personal website displaying my CV and acting as
a place to showcase my personal projects (and in the future, also programming successes). 
Sticking to a black-and-offwhite color scheme, I wanted my website to remind the viewer of
a Wordpress blog and reflect my personality. As an accent color, I used purple and a 
mediumvioletred (see the Home page's feature font), and many of the images have a greyscale 
filter, which removes itself upon hovering on the image (see Writing page's collage-image).
My website is a mixture of my social media activity, my professional CV, my writing passion,
and an insight into my travel experiences.
